    "   2. Aliasing: If you have a long or complex module name, you can import it multiple times using different aliases to make \n",

    "How can you go about creating a program that avoids mutual importing?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"To avoid circular importing and the potential issues it can cause, you can follow some best practices and design patterns. \n",
    "   Here are a few approaches to create a program that avoids mutual importing:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Restructure the code: Examine the dependencies between modules and consider refactoring the code to remove circular\n",
    "      dependencies. This might involve reorganizing functions, classes, or variables into separate modules or creating\n",
    "      additional modules to encapsulate shared functionality. By breaking up the dependencies, you can eliminate the need \n",
    "      for mutual importing.\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. Dependency injection: Instead of directly importing modules that have circular dependencies, you can pass instances \n",
    "      or references of the required objects as function arguments or constructor parameters. This approach allows you to\n",
    "      decouple the modules and avoid the need for direct importing. By relying on dependency injection, you can ensure that\n",
    "      each module only depends on the interfaces or contracts of other modules, rather than the concrete implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "   3. Importing at runtime: If circular dependencies are unavoidable due to the nature of the problem, you can import the \n",
    "      required modules at runtime when they are needed, rather than during the initial import phase. This delayed importing\n",
    "      allows you to break the circular chain and resolve the dependencies dynamically when the program flow requires it. \n",
    "      You can use techniques like lazy loading, import inside functions, or importing within specific conditional blocks \n",
    "      to control when the modules are imported.\n",
    "\n",
    "   4. Refactor shared functionality: If the circular dependencies arise from modules that share common functionality, consider\n",
    "      extracting the shared code into a separate module that both modules can import without creating a circular dependency. \n",
    "      By centralizing the shared functionality, you can avoid the circular importing issue and promote code reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "   5. Use an intermediary module: If you encounter a situation where two modules need to import each other, you can create an\n",
    "      intermediary module that acts as a bridge between them. The intermediary module can provide the necessary interfaces or \n",
    "      functions to facilitate communication between the two modules without directly importing them. This approach helps break\n",
    "      the circular dependency by introducing an additional layer of abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    " It's important to note that circular dependencies can sometimes indicate design issues in your code, and it's generally\n",
    " considered good practice to avoid them when possible. By following proper modularization, code organization, and design \n",
